# Hey there, fellow coders ! 🖖🏽🌍 
I'm a software engineer specializing in front-end development. With a strong focus on React, I love bringing ideas to life and crafting intuitive user experiences. But that's not all – when I'm not working on the latest web project, you can find me exploring the fascinating intersection of math and code. I'm passionate about creating generative art and experimenting with innovative approaches to problem-solving.
